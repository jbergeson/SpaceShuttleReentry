Space Shuttle Reentry Model
======================

This code models the flight dynamics of the space shuttle during reentry into the atmosphere. The model is limited by a heating rate constraint on the leading edge of the shuttle wings, and runs an optimization in dymos to maximize crossrange. The model was built as a testbed for the autoscaling algorithm in development for OpenMDAO and dymos.
